During the sprint planning process, I encountered challenges in prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile with stakeholder needs:

1. # Prioritization Challenges  
   Determining the priority of user stories required balancing usability, technical feasibility, and business needs. Features like stock updates were crucial, while supplier portals were secondary.

2. # Effort Estimation  
   Assigning story points was difficult, especially in estimating complex features like automatic stock updates. Using a Fibonacci sequence approach helped gauge complexity.

3. # Agile Alignment  
   As the sole stakeholder, balancing personal expectations and Agile principles required iterative refinement. Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focus helped in breaking down large requirements into deliverable sprints.
